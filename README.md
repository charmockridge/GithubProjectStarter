# Github Project Starter
A Python 3.7.3 script that automates the lengthy process of creating a Github repository. It uses the Github REST API and command-line commands to create the repository and the necessary files.

## What I learned
* How APIs are used in Python.
* The use of Github's REST API for the creation of repositories for authenticated users.
* The use of environment variables and how to access their value in Python.
* Running command-line commands in Python with the use of the subprocess module.
* Command-line arguments when running a Python file.
